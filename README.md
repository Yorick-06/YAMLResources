Addon for [Simple Resources](https://github.com/Yorick-06/SimpleResources) based on
[jackson-dataformats-text](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text) which adds support for ```.yml```/```.yaml``` files
for both minecraft and custom-registered resources.

Simply place this mod in your mods folder (SimpleResources version 2.1.0 or higher required) and all resources can now
be specified in the YAML format.
